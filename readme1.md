Most of the game fuctionality will be in the in the game_fence() method.</b>
I created this method to declare the game boundaries, scoring a point, restarting the ball position when scored with sound effect, and increments the scored when ball goes on other side.</b>

In the main method what is running is the score board. </b>

In wd method the switches are declared and that is where my assembly state machine is activated. When botton is pressed then it moves the paddle.</b>
